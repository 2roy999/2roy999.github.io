  abstract={We study the roots of a random polynomial over the field of p-adic numbers. For a random monic polynomial with i.i.d. coefficients in Zp, we obtain an estimate for the expected number of roots of this polynomial. In particular, if the coefficients take the values ±1 with equal probability, the expected number of p-adic roots converges to (p−1)/(p+1) as the degree of the polynomial tends to ∞.},
